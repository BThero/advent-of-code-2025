# Advent of Code 2025

Good day, everyone. This repository contains my solutions to puzzles from [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com).

My language of choice this time around is [Zig](https://ziglang.org). I didn't learn Zig beforehand, so you will notice me doing very silly things, especially on the earlier puzzles. 

There should be exactly two solutions for each day — the first part and the second part. However, I sometimes forget to save the code for the first part and overwrite it.

I do not care about my solving times. I do, however, care about consistency and I am aiming for all 24 stars. Best of luck to me and to everyone else who is participating!
